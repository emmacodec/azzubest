Creating my first chat app using react on the front end and firebase for the backend. Also used the Google Oauth
authentication for users to sign in with their own G-mail account and DB where data are stored, tailwind CSS for all my styling.
also used the following package for my project; react-firebase-hooks and react-google-button
in the chat component did some logic cause i don't want it to render all the time. i.e each message in the chat component has a its own component as well.
in the rel{scroll} is a custom Css that allows all message in the bottom to automatically scroll to the current message all message is stored in the state(useState). Used the useEffect so that anytime, component reload or page reload, the state changes or any update to the backend it automatically updates and render out data on the screen.
