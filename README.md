Creating my first chat app using react on the front end and firebase for the backend. Also used the Google Oauth
authentication for users to sign in with their own G-mail account and DB where data are stored, tailwind CSS for all my styling.
also used the following package for my project; react-firebase-hooks and react-google-button
in the chat component did some logic cause i don't want it to render all the time. i.e each message in the chat component has a its own component as well.
in the rel{scroll} is a custom Css that allows all message in the bottom to automatically scroll to the current message
